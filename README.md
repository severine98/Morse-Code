# Morse-Code
A page  where the user can input sentences in plain text, click on the translate button which converts the text into morse code. Vice versa, if the user wants to translate morse code into plain text: they need to click on the arrow so it turns red, then input their morse code and click on the translate button to reveal the plain text conversion.
 
## Purpose of this project
The aim of this project was to practice accessing keys and values from objects. It was a great way to get familiar with the syntax and use bootstrap buttons.
